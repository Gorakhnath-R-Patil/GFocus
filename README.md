# GFocus
*GFocus** is a free, ad-free, privacy-respecting Android launcher app designed to help working professionals stay focused by blocking distracting apps and notifications. The app offers a simple interface to whitelist selected "focus apps" that remain accessible during a focus session, while all others are hidden and their notifications suppressed.
